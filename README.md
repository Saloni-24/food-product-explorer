```
## How the App Works

- All API calls are handled in a single service file (`lib/api.ts`)
- Next.js API routes act as a server-side proxy to avoid CORS issues
- Cart state is managed using React Context and persisted in `localStorage`
- Components are modular, reusable, and follow React best practices
- Tailwind CSS handles layout, styling, and responsiveness
- Basic error handling and fallback UI are implemented for missing data
- Search, category filter, and sorting work independently without clearing each other
- Product detail page shows comprehensive information, including ingredients, nutrition, labels, and brands
- Pagination and “Load More” buttons allow smooth browsing


##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ installed
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd assignment
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

### Build for Production

```

##  API Endpoints Used

The application uses the following OpenFoodFacts API endpoints:

- **Search by name**: `https://world.openfoodfacts.org/cgi/search.pl?search_terms={name}&json=true`
- **Get by barcode**: `https://world.openfoodfacts.org/api/v0/product/{barcode}.json`
- **Filter by category**: `https://world.openfoodfacts.org/cgi/search.pl?tagtype_0=categories&tag_0={category}&json=true`
- **Popular products**: `https://world.openfoodfacts.org/cgi/search.pl?action=process&sort_by=popularity&json=true`
- **Categories list**: `https://world.openfoodfacts.org/categories.json`



##  Performance Optimizations

- Next.js Image component for optimized image loading
- API response caching with revalidation
- Lazy loading and pagination to reduce initial load time
- Efficient state management to minimize re-renders


##  Responsive Design

The application is fully responsive and tested on:
- Mobile devices (320px+)
- Tablets (768px+)
- Desktop (1024px+)
- Large screens (1280px+)


## Time Taken

**Total Development Time: Approximately 3-4 days**
